# GravityWorldModel

## Frame structure to build physical engine for stability inference.
This python repository was developed to build block-stack scenes in a simulated physical environment. All code was built inherited from [Pybullet](https://pybullet.org).

# File Illustration
## PaperCode
All code that related to the results in the manuscript [A stochastic world model on gravity for stability inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.30.522364v1)

## textures
Texture files used in the physical engine.

## utils
Basic implementation of the physical engine for investigating stability inference of humans.
Most basic functions including stack construction, stability estimation are implemented in [stability_func.py](https://github.com/helloTC/GravityWorldModel/blob/main/utils/stability_func.py)

# Acknowledgment
Thanks to [study0098](https://github.com/study0098)(Yitao Xu) for his early implementation of this repository. I reframed his code to finish followed investigations.
